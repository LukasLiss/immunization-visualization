# Simplifications in this Visualization

This project intends to visualize the effect of vaccinations on the spread of a disease.
This is done by simulating the spread of a disease. Of course, this simulation does not reflect reality perfectly. Multiple simplifications were made. Here you can find a list of some of those simulations.

In this simulation vaccinated people can not get infected or transmit the disease anymore. This does not need to hold in reality.

In this simulation, the death rate is directly affecting the percentage of people counted as dead. This does not hold in reality where of course multiple other effects play a role.
